## Linked Maps (Data)

[_Linked Maps_](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/linked-maps) is a framework to convert vector data extracted from USGS historical topographic map archives into linked and publishable spatio-temporal data as RDF.

This repository holds the original shapefile datasets for a railroad network data and their resulting RDF files (in `ttl` format) for regions in Bray, California and Louisville, Colorado.
